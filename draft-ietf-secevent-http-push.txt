                Push-Based SET Token Delivery Using HTTP
                    draft-ietf-secevent-http-push-01

Abstract

   This specification defines how a Security Event Token (SET) may be
   delivered to an intended recipient using HTTP POST.  The SET is
   transmitted in the body of an HTTP POST request to a previously
   registered endpoint, and the recipient indicates success or failure
   via the HTTP response.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a mechanism by which a holder of a
   Security Event Token ([SET]) may deliver the SET to an intended
   recipient via HTTP POST [HTTP].

   Push-Based SET Delivery over HTTP POST is intended for scenarios
   where all of the following are true:

   o  The holder of the SET is capable of making outbound HTTP requests




Backman, et al.         Expires February 28, 2019               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push          August 2018


   o  The recipient is capable of hosting an HTTP endpoint that is
      accessible to the transmitter

   o  The transmitter and recipient are known to one another

   o  The transmitter and recipient have an out-of-band mechanism for
      exchanging configuration metadata and/or security keys

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Throughout this document all figures may contain spaces and extra
   line-wrapping for readability and space limitations.

1.2.  Definitions

   This specification assumes terminology defined in the Security Event
   Token specification [SET], as well as the terms defined below:

   SET Receipt Endpoint
      An HTTP endpoint operated by the SET Receiver, which is configured
      to receive SETs in accordance with this specification.

   SET Receiver
      An entity that is prepared to receive one or more SETs from a SET
      Transmitter.

   SET Transmitter
      An entity that is in possession of a SET that is to be transmitted
      to a SET Receiver.  This MAY be the issuer of the SET or an entity
      affiliated with the issuer, but this is neither guaranteed nor
      required to be the case.

2.  Transmitting a SET

   To transmit a SET to a given SET Receiver, the SET Transmitter makes
   an HTTP POST request to the SET Receiver's SET Receipt Endpoint.  The
   "Content-Type" header of this request MUST be "application/
   secevent+jwt" as defined in Sections 2.2 and 6.2 of [SET], and the
   "Accept" header MUST be "application/json".  The body of the request
   MUST be the SET itself, represented as a [JWT] in either JWE Compact
   Serialization or JWS Compact Serialization.  [jwt_format]




Backman, et al.         Expires February 28, 2019               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push          August 2018


   The mechanism by which the SET Transmitter determines the SET Receipt
   Endpoint is not defined by this specification and may be
   implementation-specific.

   The following is a non-normative example of a SET transmission
   request:

   POST /Events  HTTP/1.1

   Host: notify.examplerp.com
   Accept: application/json
   Content-Type: application/secevent+jwt

3.  Handling a SET Transmission Request

   Upon receipt of a SET, the SET Receiver SHALL validate that all of
   the following are true:

   o  The SET Receiver can validate the SET as described in Section 7.2
      of [JWT] and Section 2 of [SET].

   o  The SET Receiver can validate the SET as described by the defining
      document(s) for the event represented within the SET, if
      applicable.

   o  The SET Receiver is identified as an intended audience of the SET.

   o  The SET Receiver can authenticate that the SET was issued by the
      issuer specified within the SET (See Section 4).





Backman, et al.         Expires February 28, 2019               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push          August 2018


   The SET Receiver MAY apply further validation tests, as appropriate
   to their use case.

   The SET Receiver SHOULD NOT perform extensive business logic that
   processes the event expressed by the SET synchronously within the
   handling of a SET transmission request.  Such logic SHOULD be
   executed asynchronously from delivery, in order to minimize the
   expense and impact of SET delivery on the SET Transmitter.

3.1.  Success Response

   If the SET Receiver successfully parses and validates the SET
   transmitted in a SET Transmission Request, the SET Receipt Endpoint
   SHALL respond with an HTTP Response Status Code of 202.  The body of
   the response MUST be empty, and the response SHOULD NOT include a
   "Content-Type" header.

   The following is a non-normative example of a response indicating
   that the SET was successfully delivered to the SET Receiver:

   HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted

              Figure 2: Example Successful Delivery Response

3.2.  Failure Response

   If the SET Receiver encounters an error parsing or validating the SET
   transmitted in a SET Transmission Request, the SET Receipt Endpoint
   MUST respond with an HTTP Response Status Code of 400.  The "Content-
   Type" header of this response MUST be "application/json", and the
   body of the response MUST be a JSON object containing two name/value
   pairs:

   description
      A string whose value is a human-readable description of the error
      that occurred.

   err
      A string whose value is the name of a Security Event Token
      Delivery Error Code.

   The SET Receipt Endpoint MAY indicate generic HTTP errors by
   responding with an appropriate HTTP Response Status Code, as
   described in Section 6 of [HTTP].

   The following is a non-normative response indicating a delivery
   failure due to a failure during signature validation:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "err":"jws",
     "description":"Unable to validate signature."

   }

                Figure 3: Example Delivery Failure Response

3.2.1.  Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes

   Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes are strings that identify a
   specific type of error that may occur when parsing or validating a
   SET.  Every Security Event Token Delivery Error Code MUST have a
   unique name registered in the IANA "Security Event Token Delivery
   Error Codes" registry established by Section 8.1.

   The following table presents the initial set of Error Codes that are
   registered in the IANA "Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes"
   registry:

4.  Authentication and Authorization

   The mechanisms by which the SET Receipt Endpoint authenticates SETs
   and callers, and confirms that a caller is authorized to transmit a
   given SET are implementation specific and thus out-of-scope for this
   document.  SET Receipt Endpoints SHOULD use standard transportation
   layer security mechanisms (such as TLS 1.2 [TLS] or later).  When TLS
   is used, the SET Receipt Endpoint MUST support TLS 1.2 or greater,
   and MAY support other versions of TLS.

   If integrity and authenticity are not provided at the transportation
   layer, the SET Receipt Endpoint MUST [must_sign] sign and/or encrypt
   the SET in accordance with [JWS] and [JWE].  The SET Receipt Endpoint
   MAY use both transportation layer security and SET signatures and/or
   encryption.

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push          August 2018


   The SET Receipt Endpoint MAY use standard HTTP authentication
   mechanisms (such as OAuth 2.0 Bearer tokens [RFC6750]) in order to
   authenticate the caller.

   See Section 6 for further guidance.

5.  Delivery Reliability

   Delivery reliability requirements may vary from implementation to
   implementation.  SET Transmitters MAY attempt to re-transmit a SET if
   they have not received a response indicating successful delivery of
   that SET, and SHOULD wait some amount of time before attempting re-
   transmission.  The specific length of this waiting period may depend
   on the types of events being transmitted, and/or the SET
   Transmitter's or SET Receiver's requirements.  As such, it is out-of-
   scope for this specification.  SET Transmitters MAY apply an
   algorithm such as exponential backoff to determine how long to wait
   in between prior to re-transmission of a given SET.

   SET Transmitters MUST NOT re-transmit a SET once the SET Receipt
   Endpoint sends a response indicating successful delivery of the SET.

   SET Transmitters with high reliability requirements may be tempted to
   always retry failed transmissions, however it should be noted that
   for many types of SET delivery errors a retry is extremely unlikely
   to be successful.  For example, "json", "jwtParse", and "setParse"
   all indicate structural errors in the content of the SET that are
   likely to remain when re-transmitting the same SET.  Others such as
   "jws" or "jwe" may be transient, for example if cryptographic
   material has not been properly distributed to the SET Receipt
   Endpoint.

   Implementers SHOULD evaluate their reliability requirements and the
   impact of various retry mechanisms on the performance of their
   systems to determine the correct strategy for various error
   conditions.

   The SET Transmitter MAY provide an out-of-band mechanism by which a
   SET Receiver may be notified of delivery failures, and MAY retain
   SETs that it failed to deliver and make them available to the SET
   Receiver via other means.

   The SET Receiver SHOULD ensure that the SET is persisted in a way
   that is sufficient to meet the SET Receiver's own reliability
   requirements, and MUST NOT [retry_dep] expect or depend on a SET
   Transmitter to re-transmit or otherwise make available to the SET
   Receiver a SET once the SET Receiver acknowledges that it was
   received successfully.

6.  Security Considerations

6.1.  Denial-of-Service

   The SET Receipt Endpoint may be vulnerable to a denial-of-service
   attack where a malicious party makes a high volume of requests
   containing invalid SETs, causing the endpoint to expend significant
   resources on cryptographic operations that are bound to fail.  This
   may be mitigated by authenticating SET Transmitters with a mechanism
   with low runtime overhead, such as mutual TLS, or statically assigned
   bearer tokens.

6.2.  Authenticating Persisted SETs

   While the SET Receipt Endpoint can rely upon transport layer
   mechanisms, HTTP authentication methods, and/or other context from
   the transmission request to authenticate the SET Transmitter and
   validate the authenticity of the SET, this context is typically
   unavailable to systems that the SET Receipt Endpoint forwards the SET
   onto, or to systems that retrieve the SET from storage.  If the SET
   Receiver requires the ability to validate SET authenticity outside of
   the context of the SET Receipt Endpoint, then the SET Transmitter
   SHOULD sign the SET in accordance with [JWS], or encrypt it using an
   authenticated encryption scheme in accordance with [JWE].
   [should_sign]

7.  Privacy Considerations

   When sharing personally identifiable information or information that
   is otherwise considered confidential to affected users, SET
   Transmitters and Receivers MUST have the appropriate legal agreements
   and user consent or terms of service in place.  [legal]

   The propagation of subject identifiers can be perceived as personally
   identifiable information.  Where possible, SET Transmitters and
   Receivers SHOULD devise approaches that prevent propagation -- for
   example, the passing of a hash value that requires the subscriber to
   already know the subject.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes

   This document defines Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes, for
   which IANA is asked to create and maintain a new registry titled
   "Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes".  Initial values for the
   Security Event Token Delivery Error Codes registry are given in
   Table 1.  Future assignments are to be made through the Expert Review

Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-secevent-http-push          August 2018


   o  Removed "Event Streams" definition (now unused).

   o  Replaced "Event Transmitter" with "SET Transmitter".

   o  Replaced "Event Receiver" with "SET Receiver".

   o  Replaced "Event Receiver endpoint" with "SET Receipt Endpoint".

   o  Removed enumeration of HTTP authentication schemes.

      service protection, and moved it to Security Considerations.

   o  Removed generally applicable guidance regarding HTTP, TLS,
      authorization tokens, and bearer tokens.

   o  Moved text regarding using JWS to determine authenticity of
      retained SETs to Security Considerations.

   o  Added guidance regarding retries and non-transient error
      conditions.

   o  Made it a normative requirement for SET Receivers to not depend on
      the SET Transmitter persisting successfully delivered SETs.

   o  Added IANA registry for SET delivery error codes.

Editorial Comments

[jwt_format] AB: The bit about JWE/JWS Compact Serialization is
             redundant, as per RFC7519 "JWTs are always represented
             using" one of those formats.  But including it seems
             helpful.

[must_sign] AB: Can we make this a MUST?  Or are there use cases for
            making this a SHOULD?

[retry_dep] AB: Does this MUST NOT make sense, given retention of SETs
            that failed delivery is permitted, per above?

[should_sign] AB: This is normative text.  Should we move it out of
              Security Considerations?

[legal] AB: Does this belong in the specification?
